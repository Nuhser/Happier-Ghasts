This enchantment can be applied to a harness of any color. It comes in three levels and speeds up your Happy Ghast if it wears the enchanted harness.

Each level grants a speed boost of 25% of the base speed. Therefore, a Happy Ghast wearing a harness which is enchanted with **Aerodynamic III** flies with 175% of its normal speed.

The enchantment can be bought from villagers or enchanted onto harnesses and books using an enchanting table.

> [!NOTE]
> Only harnesses crafted after enabling this datapack will be enchantable in an enchanting table.

## Advancements

### Vapor Velocity

You can get this advancement by riding a Happy Ghast which is wearing a harness that was enchanted with **Aerodynamic III**.
