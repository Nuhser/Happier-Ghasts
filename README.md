This enchantment can be applied to a harness of any color. It comes in three levels and speeds up your Happy Ghast if it wears the enchanted harness.

Each level grants a speed boost of 25% of the base speed. Therefore, a Happy Ghast wearing a harness which is enchanted with **Aerodynamic III** flies with **175% of its normal speed**.

The enchantment can be bought from villagers or enchanted onto harnesses and books using an enchanting table.<br/>
If the *Villager Trade Rebalance* experiment is active in your world, this enchantment will be sold by **Plains Villagers** as a **common** trade.

## Advancements

### Vapor Velocity

You can get this advancement by riding a Happy Ghast which is wearing a harness that was enchanted with **Aerodynamic III**.
