# Happier Ghasts - Data Pack for Minecraft

This data pack improves Happy Ghasts by adding enchantments for their harnesses.<br/>
There's a resource pack available as well which provides English and German translations for the content from the data pack. If the resource pack isn't used, the texts will default to English.

There are enchantments for increasing the Ghast's flight speed as well as its tempting range. This should make it easier to get the Ghast back down to you.

For more information take a look at the data pack's [Wiki](https://github.com/Nuhser/Happier-Ghasts/wiki).

You can find the latest release of both, the data and resource pack, [here](https://github.com/Nuhser/Happier-Ghasts/releases/latest) or on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/datapack/nuhser-happier-ghasts/versions).

> [!WARNING]
> You need to close and reopen your world in singleplayer or restart your server for multiplayer after installing or updating this data pack. Otherwise, the enchantments won't work.

*Feel free to create a pull request on GitHub if you want to provide translations for more languages.*
