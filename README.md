# Happier Ghasts - Data Pack for Minecraft

This data pack improves Happy Ghasts by adding multiple enchantments for their harnesses.\
There is an enchantments for increasing the Ghast's flight speed. Another enchantment grants a higher tempting range which should make it easier to get the Ghast back down to you. Other enchantments grant your Happy Ghast higher protection against different damage types.

There's a resource pack available as well which provides English and German translations for the content from the data pack. If the resource pack isn't used, the texts will default to English.
